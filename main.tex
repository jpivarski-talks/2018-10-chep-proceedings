%% In the last stages of data analysis, only order-of-magnitude computing speedups translate into increased human productivity, and only if they're not difficult to set up. Producing a plot in a second instead of an hour is life-changing, but not if it takes two hours to write the analysis code. Fortunately, HPC-inspired techniques can result in such large speedups, but unfortunately, they can be difficult to use in a HEP setting.

%% These techniques generally favor operating on columns— arrays representing a single attribute across events, rather than whole events individually— which allows data to stream predictably from disk media to main memory and finally to CPU/GPU/KNL onboard memory (e.g. L* cache) for prefetching and sometimes allows for for vectorization. However, the need to work with variable-length structures in HEP, such as different numbers of particles per event, makes it difficult to apply this technique to HEP problems.

%% We will describe several new software tools to make it easier to compute analysis functions with columnar arrays in HEP: array-at-a-time I/O in ROOT ("BulkIO") and Python/Numpy ("uproot"), compiling object-oriented analysis code into columnar operations ("oamap" for "object-array mapping"), and storage solutions with columnar granularity. We will show performance plots and usage examples.
